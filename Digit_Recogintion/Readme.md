# 🔢 MNIST Digit Recognition Project

*Because teaching computers to read your terrible handwriting is apparently what we do for fun now* 📝

## 🎯 What This Project Does

Ever wondered if a computer could recognize your handwriting better than your doctor? Well, wonder no more! This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using the famous MNIST dataset. Then it lets you draw digits like a 5-year-old and watch the AI struggle... or succeed magnificently! 🎨

## 🚀 Features That'll Blow Your Mind (Or At Least Mildly Impress You)

- 🤖 **Smart CNN Model**: Uses TensorFlow/Keras to build a neural network that's smarter than your average calculator
- 🎨 **Drawing Interface**: A Tkinter-based GUI where you can unleash your inner artist (even if you draw like a potato)
- 📊 **Real-time Predictions**: Watch the AI guess what you drew faster than you can say "machine learning"
- 📈 **Training Visualization**: Pretty graphs that make you feel like a data scientist
- 🎯 **High Accuracy**: Achieves >98% accuracy (better than most humans reading doctor's prescriptions)
- 🔄 **Easy Pipeline**: One-click setup because ain't nobody got time for complex installations

# 🛠️ Installation (The "Please Don't Break" Guide)
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ (because we're not living in the stone age)
- A computer (surprisingly important)
- Working fingers (for drawing digits)
- Patience (for training the model)

### Step 1: Clone This Masterpiece
```
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Digit_Recognition
```
### Step 2: Install Dependencies (The Magic Ingredients)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If pip throws a tantrum, try:
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 3: Run the Pipeline (The Easy Button)
```
python run_simple_pipeline.py
```
# 🎮 Usage Guide (How to Use This Thing)
## Option 1: The Full Experience 🎬
### Run the main pipeline and follow the menu:
```
python run_simple_pipeline.py
```
### Menu Options:

1. 🧪 Quick Test - Make sure everything works (recommended for paranoid people)
2. 🤖 Train Model - Train the AI (grab a coffee, this takes 5-10 minutes)
3. 🎨 Launch Drawing App - The fun part! Draw and predict digits
4. 🔄 Retrain Model - Because you can never have too much accuracy
5. ❌ Exit - Goodbye cruel world

## Option 2: Just Train the Model 🏋️
```
python mnist_digit_recognition.py
```
## Option 3: Just Use the Drawing App 🎨
```
python digit_drawing_ui.py
```
(Note: You need a trained model first, obviously)

# 🎨 How to Use the Drawing App

1. <b>Launch the app</b> - A window will appear (hopefully)
2. <b>Draw a digit</b> - Use your mouse to draw a digit (0-9) in the white canvas
3. <b>Click "Predict Digit"</b> - Watch the AI work its magic
4. <b>Marvel at the results</b> - See confidence scores for all digits
5. <b>Click "Clear Canvas"</b> - Start over when you mess up (we've all been there)

## Pro Tips for Better Recognition 💡
- <b>Draw BIG</b> - Don't be shy, use the whole canvas
- <b>Draw BOLD</b> - Thick lines work better than hair-thin sketches
- <b>Center your digit</b> - The AI likes well-centered digits (it's OCD like that)
- <b>One digit only </b>- Don't get creative with multiple digits
# 📊 Model Performance
## My CNN achieves:

- <b>Training Accuracy:</b> ~99.5% (show-off)
- <b>Test Accuracy:</b> ~98.8% (still impressive)
- <b>Training Time:</b> 5-10 minutes (time for a coffee break)
- <b>Model Size:</b> ~2MB (lightweight champion)
## Model Architecture (For the Nerds 🤓)
Conv2D(32) → MaxPool → Conv2D(64) → MaxPool → Conv2D(64) → 
Flatten → Dense(64) → Dropout(0.5) → Dense(10, softmax)
# 🔧 Troubleshooting (When Things Go Wrong)
## "TensorFlow won't install!" 😫
```
pip install tensorflow-cpu==2.15.0
```
Or try the regular version if you're feeling adventurous:

```
pip install tensorflow==2.15.0
```
## "The model always predicts the same digit!" 🤔
- Make sure you're drawing clearly
- Try drawing bigger/bolder
- Check if the preprocessing is working (the app shows debug info)
- Remember: garbage in, garbage out
## "Training is taking forever!" ⏰
- Be patient, good things take time
- Consider reducing epochs in the code
- Maybe grab a snack? 🍕
### "ImportError: No module named X" 😵
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### If that doesn't work, install packages individually:
```
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pillow opencv-python
```
# 🎯 Technical Details (For the Curious)
## Dataset
- <b>MNIST:</b> 60,000 training images + 10,000 test images
- <b>Image Size:</b> 28x28 pixels, grayscale
- <b>Classes:</b> 10 digits (0-9)
## Data Augmentation
- <b>Rotation:</b> ±10 degrees (because not everyone writes straight)
- <b>Zoom:</b> ±10% (for the size-challenged digits)
- <b>Shifts:</b> ±10% width/height (because centering is hard)
## Training Features
- <b>Early Stopping:</b> Stops when validation accuracy plateaus (smart!)
- <b>Learning Rate Reduction:</b> Reduces learning rate when stuck
- <b>Data Augmentation:</b> Makes the model more robust
- <b>Dropout:</b> Prevents overfitting (the AI equivalent of not cramming for exams)
